<h1>Privacy policy of SpaceNotes</h1>

Effective Date: 26.06.2025
Welcome to SpaceNotes. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy will inform you about how we handle your data when you visit our website, regardless of where you visit it from, and tell you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
We collect your email address to authenticate you when you sign in. Your documents and account information are stored on Supabase along with your email. When you use our service to share content or view external link previews, certain indirect information may also be collected by the previewed external resources, including:
External Link Previews: When you paste an external link on SpaceNotes, we fetch a preview of that link, which may include images. These images are hot-loaded from that external site, which means that your IP address may be shared with that site each time the content is viewed.

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
We use your email solely to authenticate you and to associate your documents with your account. This information is stored on Supabase. We also use indirect information to provide link previews and enable content sharing and real-time collaboration on our platform.

<h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
All content you create and your account details are stored unencrypted on Supabase servers. We authenticate users through Supabase using their email address. Documents you share with others may be viewed and edited by anyone with the link.

Shared content can be collaboratively edited in real-time. All changes are immediately visible to users with whom you have shared the document. Peers can see the browser name and color of the cursor of other users editing the content.

<h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
You may request access to or deletion of the personal data we store about you, including your email address and documents saved in Supabase. Please contact us if you wish to exercise these rights.

<h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting an update.
